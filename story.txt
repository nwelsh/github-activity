Liza: Arnold got home after a long day of work and was so excited to eat his sandwich from Jimmy Johns. The day before, he had gone out to eat with friends and had extras of his sandwich ready to eat that he was so excited to eat today. But when he got home, he came to a shocking realization: the sandwich was gone!

Rowan: Where could it have gone? Arnold was very perplexed. He had no pets, and his neighbors couldn't of gotten into his house! Then, Arnold had a stroke of luck, and saw some lettuce on the floor, followed by a bit of tomato, creating a path that lead out his backdoor.

Nicole: In his backdoor, arnold found Jimmy John in his back yard. Jimmy John explained to arnold that that sandwich was the sandwich that jimmy john had put a tracker in. Jimmy wanted this sandwich all to himself and in exchange Jimmy gave Arnold a year supply of subs.
